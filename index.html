                <p>
                    Pizza TumTummy is the largest pizza restaurant chain in the world based on global retail sales, with
                    more than 17,800 stores in over 90 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza
                    delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Although we are
                    a highly-recognized global brand, we focus on serving the local neighborhoods in which we live and
                    do business through our large network of franchise owners and Company-owned stores. On average, we
                    sell more than 3 million pizzas each day throughout our global system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our business model is straightforward: we handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price,
                    with easy ordering access and efficient service which are aided by our technology innovations. Our
                    dough is generally made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pizza TumTummy generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties to its franchisees. Royalties
                    are
                    ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino's brand marks. The Company also generates
                    revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S.
                    and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and
                    other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant
                    geographical rights to the Domino's PizzaÂ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees
                    also profit by running pizza stores, and often by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and
                    equipment to those sub-franchisees. Everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer,
                    who can feed their family Pizza TumTummy menu items conveniently and economically.
